# Brick Breacker game

Brick Break is a game where you have to break bricks using the ball and the paddle. The bricks have different levels represented by colors. When you break a brick there is a chance that it will give you a bonus. Once all the bricks are broken, you will move on to the next level !


## How to play ?

Throw the ball by pressing ***space***.

Move the paddle by pressing the ***left*** or ***right arrow***.


## The angle of the ball is determined by where it bounces off the paddle

If the ball falls in the center of the paddle, it will go straight back (90Â°).

If the ball touches the edge of the paddle, it will leave at an angle close to horizontal.


## Try not to lose any lives !

When a ball hits the ground and no more balls are in play, you will lose a **life**.

You will start the game with 3 lives.

You can gain lives by taking the +1 life bonus.
